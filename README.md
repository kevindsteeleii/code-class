# Code Classes
This repo is an attempt to create an online, public record to ~~shame~~ motivate me while I work hard to fill my gaps in knowledge and build on what I already know.

## Class Listing

This will be a simple listing of the class/course being taken, links, and other info I find pertinent along with a relative link to the directory that holds it.
