# Code Classes
This repo is an attempt to create an online, public record to ~~shame~~ motivate me while I work hard to fill my gaps in knowledge and build on what I already know.

## Class Listing
This will be a simple listing of the class/course being taken, links, and other info I find pertinent along with a relative link to directory that holds it.
- [ ] [COURSERA - Princeton Algorithms I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/), 
  - [repo link](./coursera-algorithms-part-)
  - Taught by Robert Sedgewick 
  - textbook **Algorithms 4th ed.** by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne (I know he wrote the book but it's a decent text for folks who don't remember Calculus or advanced proofs off the top of their head) 
  - [online book site w/ additional useful content](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/)
