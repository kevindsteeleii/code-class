### 1.4 - 1.5 Data Types, Abstract Data Types (ADT), and Data Structures

#### Data Types vs Abstract Data Types (ADT)

A *data type* is an attribute of data that which tells the compiler or interpreter what the programmer intends to do with/treat the data. For example: *integers*, *floats*, *strings* are data types.

*Abstract data types* are data types that do not explicitly have an implementation (ergo the abstract bit) and may be implemented using pre-existing data types. Examples include: *queues*, *priority queues*, **

#### Data Structures

*Data structures* are the concrete implementation of *abstract data types* (programmed).
