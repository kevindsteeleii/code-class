7.) Research the *\_\_radd__* method. How does it differ from *\_\_add__*? When is it used? Implement *\_\_radd__*.

**Answer:** The difference between *\_\_radd__* and *\_\_add__* is that when the *+* operator is not used in the order implied by the overload, *\_\_radd__* has to be used in its stead. For example:

```python3
class Other:
     def __init__(self):
          pass

class Obj:
     def __init__(self):
          pass

     def __add__(self, other):
          return self + other # in that order

     __radd__ = __add__

obj = Obj()
other = Other()
print(obj + other) # calls obj.__add__(other)
print(other + obj) # calls other.__add__(obj) but that does not exist making __radd__ necessary
```

8.) Repeat the last question but this time consider the *\_\_iadd__* method.

**Answer:** *\_\_iadd__*  is different in that when invoked it returns x += y as opposed to x + y

9.) Research the *\_\_repr__* method. How does it differ from *\_\_str__*? When is it used? Implement *\_\_repr__*.

**Answer:**
The *\_\_str__* method returns the string representation of an instance while *\_\_repr__* is used to return a string representation that is usually used with a debugger and has a limited length.

10.) Research other types of gates that exist (such as NAND, NOR, and XOR). Add them to the circuit hierarchy. How much additional coding did you need to do?

**Answer:**
They only required a copy/paste of their converse method and negated values.
